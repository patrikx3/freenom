## To be able to register and renew FREE DOMAINS

Before, we were able to register and renew with free domains, but by now, these functions are allowed and working ONLY with PAID domains.

## API

http://www.freenom.com/en/freenom-api.html

I am using these only right now. So no other functions but very easy to add in and Promise based.

```js
const Freenom = require('p3x-freenom');
const freenom = await Freenom({
    email: 'p3x@corifeus',
    password: 'password',
});

await freenom.service.ping();

await freenom.domain.search({
    domainname: 'patrikx3.com',
    domaintype: 'FREE'
})

await freenom.domain.delete({ domainname: 'random.tk'));

await freenom.domain.register({
        domainname: [
            'random.tk',
            'random1.tk',
            'random2.tk',
        ],
        domaintype: 'FREE',
        period: '1Y',
        nameserver: [
            'ns1.ns.tk',
            'ns2.ns.tk',
        ]
})

await freenom.domain.delete, {  domainname: domains })

// if you have no domain in the list, instead of
// giving an empty list, it shows and error!!!
// so make sure you have one in the domain list
// because freenom.domain.expiringRenew will of course
// throw an error as well!!!
await freenom.domain.list()
```

# The good extra functions 

It automatically renew the free domains (it checks if it is within 14 days expiry and then does it).

```js
// just a helper, you don't relly need it
const renewable = await freenom.domain.expiring({
    expiry: '60 days',
});

// the magic
await freenom.domain.expiringRenew({
    period: '12M',
})
```
